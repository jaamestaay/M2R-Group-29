This is the GitHub repository for the MATH50002 Group Research Project (M2R) project on Scientific Machine Learning by Group 29 (James Tay, Jiaru Li, Xinyan Wang, Tianshi Liu, Jiankuan Liu).

Things we have been working on:

Jiaru Li:
- Description and explanation of neural network (NN) and how it works, based on Lab 5 of SciMLSANUM2024.
- Some simple applications to further illustrate the concepts.
  (1) Regression. Polynomial regression was introduced in the numerical analysis course, and I am going to take the ideas further and discuss nonlinear regression based on NN. Comparison of least squares and NN methods will also be discussed, in order to explore the ways in which NN becomes powerful.
  (2) Number recognition using MNIST. Being a standard example from machine learning, it helps us to discover how NN works in terms of real-world applications.
- Julia code to accompany the ideas. Where appropriate, Python will also be used.
